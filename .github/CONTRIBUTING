# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

## Testing

We have a set of molecule tests ensuring that everything works as expected and the role remains idempotent. Also, the
tests lint all YAML files according to our lint definition. We also have a Vagrant definition for testing changes
locally in a virtual machine.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/ultratendency/kerberos_server/pull/new/master) with a clear list
of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull
request, we will love you forever if you extend the molecule test suite. We can always use more test coverage. Please
follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes
should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact.
    >
    > Resolves #5"

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

* We indent using two spaces
* We use the extended syntax for Ansible tasks, meaning

```yaml
- name: Copy the client configuration file 
  template:
    src: krb5.conf.j2
    dest: /etc/krb5.conf
```

instead of

```yaml
- name: Copy the client configuration file 
  template: src=krb5.conf.j2 dest=/etc/krb5.conf
```

* testinfra tests should be as small as possible and test a simple aspect, such as all services are up and running
